### üëΩ Alien Football Simulator ‚öΩÔ∏è

This is a text-based game in which you must assemble a competent squad to defeat the aliens.
This is a game I made during my first semester at UVA to help hone my Java skills. Looking back at it, the code I write nowadays is far, far better than the code in this repository. For example, instead of manually checking for typos in the squad selection phase, I could've create a Trie to deal with typos far more efficiently. However, this is a still a worthwhile project, and I'm glad I did it. It was a fun 2,000 lines of code I wrote.
